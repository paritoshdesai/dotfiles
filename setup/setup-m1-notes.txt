- Start out by getting  nix

  sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume

- Install ssh keys

  ssh-keygen

- Get a shell with  packages on nix (this is just in a temp shell, no permanent changes)

  nix-shell -p git emacs

- Go to dotfiles/home (containing shell.nix) and launch a fresh nix-shell
  home $> nix-shell

- Now use home-manager to install packages, using build and switch flags
  (to build, but not install it)
  
  home-manager build 

- now use switch to actually install it (-b bak will move files that are clashing automatically to <file>.bak)

  home-manager switch

  home-manager switch -b bak

- We had to work through a few setup bugs and needed to do the following (9Jul2021):
  > fix the cabal/config file to point to the right home directory (/Users/paritosh)
  > Had to use a different version of GHC
  > need to start lorri shell in Haskell-by-Example

- we tried running sell in Emacs (in RL-book/haskell directory)
- then, we did "lorri shell" "cabal build" --> didn't work with vector package not found
- after lot of heartache, "cabal clean" and "cabal build" fixed it!
- <<Tip>> C-c s to start a new shell

- In order to get a localized env, we should navigate to head-of-repo/haskell, launch shell (at this location)
  and run nix-shell or "lorri shell" -- might need to do this first time one is initializing for the new repo
